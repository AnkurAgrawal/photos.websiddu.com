I thoroughly enjoyed the wide variety of scenery on this trip and was starting to get the hang of driving on the left side of the road. I arrived at the hotel in the early afternoon, made some coffee — the hotel staff conveniently gave me fresh milk upon check-in — and relaxed a bit before heading back out.
